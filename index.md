1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
**The topic I'm looking forward to this quarter and find fascinating is being able to measure a person's income based on bank transactions. As for topics/methods I've actually done at this point, was using an LLM to perform multi-class classification after being pretrained on a large corpus.**

2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
**I'd like to investigate on how banks themselves categorize people's transactions if those methods are public knwoledge. If so, I want to use their models/APIs and fine-tune it to make my own model for our task in predicting credit scores.**

3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
**A change I would make at this point, is making more features for the model to perform better in categorization. I already tried doing it with an LLM with little success, but want to look more into it in the future.**

4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
**Techniques I'd be willing to try out is similarity alogrithms (like cosine Jaccard, Pearson, etc.) to help in using bank memos for my categorization task this quarter. I want to see if I can find some structure among the memos that could help predict if a memo is concerned with groceries, income, travelling, and etc.**
